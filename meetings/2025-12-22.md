### nodejs/web-team

* https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/8347
  * Aviv, summarize issue
  * Michele, Orama `boost` feature allows us to boost the title over subheadings
  * Michele, Orama also has a `threshold` feature to make retrieval okay
  * Claudio, For example, searching `write file` doesn't return `fs.writeFile` as the first result
  * Michele, we need to change the tokenization to understand `camel case` as the same as `camelCase`
  * Aviv, let's try `boost` and the fixed tokenization
  * Michele, Orama will provide us with a demo search environment to preview the fixes
  * Michele, Orama needs examples of search queries that need fixing
  * Michele, we have some bundle size fixes being pushed within the week
  * 
* Add @ryanaslett to web-infra [#78](https://github.com/nodejs/web-team/issues/78)

* Openness of Meetings [#60](https://github.com/nodejs/web-team/issues/60)
  * Enabled 
* (Possibly) Record Meetings [#59](https://github.com/nodejs/web-team/issues/59)
  * Matt, Zoom AI can take notes
  * Aviv, Ooh! Let's try it
  * Zoom AI Enabled
* Disband @nodejs/ux-and-design [#11](https://github.com/nodejs/web-team/issues/11)
  * Aviv, there's very little individuals on this team
    * Matt, +1
  * Claudio, the team was originally a _paid_ position for individuals responsible for design (i.e. Bleasel), today, it's not used
  * Escalated to TSC to perform disbanding

## Q&A, Other

* Michele (Orama) has asked the web team to compile a short list (5-7 items) of search queries that need improvement. For example, `write file` should return `fs.writeFile`.
