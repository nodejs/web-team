# Onboarding Guide

This folder outlines the steps required to onboard a new member to the @nodejs/web team and its subteams.

## General Requirements

Before onboarding the **Nominee**, ensure they have read and understand [the governance of the @nodejs/web team](../GOVERNANCE.md).

- [ ] If the **Nominee** is not yet part of the @nodejs GitHub organization, verify that they have two-factor authentication enabled. Membership cannot be granted without it.
- [ ] The **Nominee** should submit a pull request to this repository, adding themselves to [the MEMBERS.md file](../MEMBERS.md). This pull request should also include this onboarding checklist, along with any additional requirements specified.
