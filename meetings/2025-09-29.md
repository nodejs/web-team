### nodejs/nodejs.org

* content(`userland-migration`): make up to date [#8053](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/8053)
    * Alex, Codemod explanation. Codemods are only used when they are officially endorsed
    * Alex, plan:
        * "Userland Migrations" blog cat
            * Migration guides
            * Changelogs
            * See other frameworks, like React, for inspiration
        * "Userland Migrations" learn
            * What is a codemod?
            * Basic description
            * **Not for migration guides**
        * Use Docs banner for migration guides 
    * Claudio, Migrations don't need to go in Learn, it's for concepts, not "things"
        * Leave things light, people can use MDN for specifics
        * Release/Other blog posts are the ideal place for these
            * (Aviv +1)
            * It's important to understand that certain blog posts must come from a certain team, that's not entirely in the website team's control. Perhaps get in touch with Releasers and/or Marketing.
    * Brian, can we add banners _after_ the fact, since Codemod's take time to develop
        * Claudio, true, Codemod's won't be instantly ready, we'd need to change the banner dynamically.

### nodejs/doc-kit

* Generate Type Declarations [#437](https://github.com/nodejs/doc-kit/issues/437)
    * Brian, why doesn't Node.js ship it's own types
    * Claudio, no runtime does, each provides out-of-house
        * It's hard for the system to know _which_ version of Node.js you are using, and thus, another package is ideal
        * It's hard to identify _where_ the types are
    * Jake, if it were bundled, we (Node.js) would be respnsosible for a lot of compat we aren't expert in
    * Current issues:
        * "Goofy" types for cross-compat with the DOM
        * Too many manual changes
        * The script doesn't really use the docs *super* offten
    * Claudio, we would like to reduce the manual work
        * New engine (`doc-kit`) can infer interfaces
    * Aviv, while making `doc-kit`, we noticed many issues with the current Structure
    * Rene, the source is _human_ readable, but not very _machine_ readable
        * Current tooling can't do multiple types in a single Array, i.e. `buffer.Blob`
        * It's hard to interop with the Web API
        * Making it machine readable it's fruitful, since it'll still need changes in TypeScript
        * Documentation isn't the primary focus of code review
        * If the docs were strongly-typed, it would help, but it would make them extremely rigid.
    * Claudio, this is something we can and should change
    * Jake, types are also generic, when, it reality, they are different in various TypeScript versions.
        * In TS's DOM Lib, the raw spec is taken, converted to types, and patches are applied on top.
    * Brian, even if we don't make it perfect and hands-off, we can make it better
    * Aviv, we should bring these types to the collaborators, and work to make the docs rigid
    * Rene, unless there is a shift in code review, that'll always be a problem
        * We could, however, build better types in the markdown
    * Claudio, we have AST in our new generator to create very precise JSON
        * We can make this format entirely our own, as consumable and reliable as possible
        * It's worth it to make the DX high and the pain low
    * Claudio, DefinetelyTyped can import `doc-kit` for their parsing
        *  Aviv, we can add a generator to put it in a format best of them
        *  Claudio, we can lint the docs to make their types compatible
    * Rene, we can leverage this, but garbage in -> garabage out
        * It'll cause an awful lot of upstream changes 
        * Aviv's PR to use the same list format was an example of something that helped standardize 
        * The primary objective is to make the docs readable for DT maintainers
    * Claudio, if you (Rene + Jake) can look over the codebase, and find what stands out, and what is needed, now is the best time to make changes
        * We appreciate DTS, and we wan't to give back
        * We have the ability to do so much
        * We do need to, however, change the status quo on the docs
    * 

### nodejs/web-team
