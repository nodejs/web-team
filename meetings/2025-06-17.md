## Agenda

### nodejs/nodejs.org

* https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/7773

    * After some discussion, it was agreed that we do need to move forward with promoting this ESP as the situation with folks using EOL versions is a significant security problem for the ecosystem (for example, Node.js 12 is getting ~25 million downloads per month still), and with the agreement that's in place with the ESP, it will also help bring in some additional cash into Node.js.
    * The plan seems to be:
        * Move forward with the [redesigned homepage](https://nodejs-org-git-fork-canerakdas-feat-simplified-download-openjs.vercel.app/), but with `Getting Involved` replaced with a `Get EOL Security Updates` button (final text tbd, might want to mention Node.js 18 specifically)
        * Adding a global banner for a short while to promote the EOL blog post
        * Ensure that we hook the button + banner up to click tracking in Vercel to give us data
    * Our aim, ideally, is to have this live on Monday so that we can start getting numbers on how this is doing (this should be coordinated w/ @kyliewd). This might not be the final state, consider this somewhat an experiment as we see what traffic and conversions this generates, and if it increases awareness for upgrading Node.js versions as well.
