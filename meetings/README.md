# Web Team Meetings

This document outlines the process for the Node.js Web Team meetings.

## Meeting Schedule

The Web Team holds meetings every 4 weeks to discuss and align on key topics related to Node.js web properties. These meetings help move initiatives forward more efficiently than asynchronous communication alone.

For exact dates and times, refer to the [Node.js Calendar](https://nodejs.org/calendar).

In rare cases, a Web Team member may call for an additional meeting outside the regular monthly schedule if there are urgent matters that cannot wait until the next scheduled meeting. All other meeting procedures still apply.

## Meeting Types

We have two types of meetings depending on the content to be discussed:

### 1. Public Meetings

- Recorded or streamed publicly
- Full minutes published in this repository
- For general planning, public PRs, RFCs, etc.
- All members of @nodejs/nodejs-website and @nodejs/web-infra are invited to attend

### 2. Limited Meetings

- Not streamed publicly
- Minutes taken, but only non-sensitive portions are published
- Sensitive portions are logged to a private repository
- For infrastructure topics involving sensitive data (e.g., credentials, access)

The meeting type will be clearly indicated in advance in the meeting announcement.

In exceptional cases where a meeting cannot be known about publicly for security or other sensitive reasons, all standard procedures should still apply, but the meeting and its documentation should be handled entirely through the private repository rather than this public one.

## Meeting Moderation

Each meeting is led by a designated moderator who is responsible for:

- Keeping the discussion on track
- Ensuring all agenda items are covered
- Managing time effectively
- Ensuring meeting notes are taken and shared
- Facilitating decision-making when consensus is needed

For regularly scheduled monthly meetings, the moderator is typically a Web Admin. For exceptional meetings called outside the regular schedule, the Web Team member who called the meeting, or a chosen delegate, serves as the moderator.

## Agenda Items

An issue must be opened in this repository prior to each meeting containing the proposed agenda items. While this issue serves as the foundation for the meeting, the agenda is only finalized at the start of the meeting when all participants have had a chance to propose additional items.

Any community member or contributor can request items to be added to the meeting agenda:

1. Create a GitHub Issue in the nodejs/web-team repository
2. A Collaborator can add the `web-agenda` label to include it in the next meeting

The agenda is not intended to review or approve all patches; that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger group of Collaborators.

At the start of each meeting, the moderator will share the agenda with members of the Web Team. Team members can add any items they like to the agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the Web Team cannot veto or remove items added to the agenda.

## Meeting Participation

Meeting attendance is optional but encouraged for Web Team members. Any community member or contributor is welcome to observe public meetings.

Members of the Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and core collaborators are always welcome to attend and participate in public Web Team meetings, unless otherwise stated.

The Web Team may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to participate in a non-voting capacity when their expertise or input would be valuable to the discussion.
