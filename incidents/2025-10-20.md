## Impact

Users navigating to `https://nodejs.org/en/download` would see a blank page instead of the proper download instructions.

`https://nodejs.org/en/download/current` was unaffected by this issue.

## Root Cause

It was assumed that there would always be an active LTS version of Node.js.
This was not the case with the release of v22.21.0, since v22 moved into Maintenance LTS while v24 still had a week until it became Active LTS.

Since there was no active LTS release, the downloads page rendered nothing.

## Fix

The fix ([nodejs/nodejs.org#8251](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/8251)) was to make the downloads page look for the Maintenance LTS version if the Active LTS version does not exist.

## Follow-up Work

- Better in-the-moment contemplation of use of status page
- Better Playwright tests are needed
  - We need to test the actual content of the pages instead of just testing for a successful status code.
